This post will take you through some interesting work that I have been doing for my project under FOSSASIA. This project is being done under the google summer of code platform. I have been working on various code scripts as my project is all about improving the tools of the sTeam collaboration platform. But this particular script is a command line interface that I am thrilled to work on. 
If you are not familiar with what sTeam is, you can look it up here, [sTeam](http://societyserver.org/Topics/sTeam/)
If you are new to the sTeam platform, this script will take you through the sTeam commands and the interface, also making sure, you have fun in the process. It lets the user play with sTeam and get to know more about how it works. One other interesting concept is that of MUDs(Multi user dungeons/dimensions). Some of you may already be familiar with the concept of MUDs( others, please look it up here [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). We have tried to bring the MUD kind of experience to this sTeam interface (like I said, thrilling!).
Let me start with how sTeam originally works for any user. This picture will give you a clear view about it.

I have seen people go through a lot of tutorials on git, and the commands(sometimes complex) through which it operates, and yet, people have difficulty learning it. What if it had a MUD type of interaction, which would just let you type "create file" "commit file" "get commit content" "upload file" "rename file" "goto repo", etc. Wouldnt it be much easier that way? Well, sTeam is going through all the extensive tool development so that it can make a user-friendly interaction. Here are some screenshots of this interface,
