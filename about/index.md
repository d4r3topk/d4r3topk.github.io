A Tech Enthusiast with a vision of learning new things with all my varied experiences of life. Food is my first love, family is my life and my friends are the ones who made me what I am today.

I am a student at PES University, Bangalore currently pusuing BE in Computer Science and Engineering. This blog will mainly consist of.......anything and everything! New Experiences, right or wrong, Technology, reviews, travel, economy, Softwares, food. Ping me if you want me to write about something. :smirk:
